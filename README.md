Project Name: DevSphere Blog

Project Description:

DevSphere is a feature-rich blogging platform designed for developers and tech enthusiasts. It distinguishes between administrators and users to streamline interactions:  
Administrators can publish, edit, and delete articles. They also manage comments and user accounts.  
Users can explore articles, leave comments, and manage their comments.  

The platform is user-friendly, incorporating:  
Google Authentication for seamless login.  
Future enhancements include dark/light mode, advanced search by categories or terms, and flexible sorting (newest/oldest).  

This project exemplifies the seamless front-end, back-end, and database systems integration.

Learning Objectives:


Gain hands-on experience with **authentication** using Google OAuth.  
Understand role-based access control for administrators and users.  
Deepen knowledge of full-stack development and RESTful API integration.  
Implement modern design concepts (dark/light mode).  
Explore advanced search and filtering mechanisms.  

Technologies Used:


Front-End: React, CSS (or Tailwind/Bootstrap for styling).  
Back-End: Node.js with Express.js.  
Database: MongoDB (or any preferred database).  
Authentication: Google OAuth 2.0.  
Development Tools: Postman for API testing, npm for dependency management.

Steps to Install and Run the Project:


1. Clone the GitHub repository:  
  		git clone https://github.com/NourFagou/DevSphere.git
2. Install dependencies:
  		npm install  
3. Open two terminal windows:
Navigate to the client folder: 
     		cd client
     		npm run dev
Navigate to the API folder:
     		cd api
     		npm start
4. Open your browser's link generated by `npm run dev`.

Challenges Identified:


Integrating Google OAuth with a seamless user experience.
Implementing role-based access for admin and users effectively.
Designing an intuitive search and filter system.
Ensuring responsiveness for various screen sizes.

Mockups and Enhancements:

Consider creating mockups for:
The homepage (light and dark mode).
Admin dashboard with article and comment management.
User profile section.
